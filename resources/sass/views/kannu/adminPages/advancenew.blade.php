The core committee consists of 23 members comprising of 1 Overall Coordinator at the helm and 22 Managers. Techfest is a true believer in the concept of a team of equals. Every brickbat is shared equally by the team as is in every bouquet. Although every aspect of Techfest is no closer to one manager than the other but for smooth functioning, certain portfolios are allocated to every manager.
<br>
<br>
The portfolios can be broadly categorised into two sections - administration and events. The administrative portfolios primarily include tasks like accounts, infrastructure, media and marketing, hospitality, publicity, web and creatives. The events portfolios include responsibility for each of the numerous happenings and initiatives taken by Techfest each year. A team of over 800 Coordinators and Organisers along with their respective managers work in sync to execute and implement the splendid spectacle called Techfest.
