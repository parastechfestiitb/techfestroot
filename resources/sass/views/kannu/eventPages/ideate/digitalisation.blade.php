		<p>
			Digitalization is the process of the technologically-induced change within industries. This process has enabled much of the phenomena today known as the Internet of Things, Industrial Internet, Industry 4.0, Big data, machine to machine communication, blockchain, cryptocurrencies etc. The debate surrounding digitalization has therefore gained increased practical importance for politics, business and social issues, and is linked to political work issues for community development, new changes in the practical business approaches, effective opportunities for organizations in operational and business process development, with effect on internal and external efficiency of IT to name a few.

<b>Prototype and Final Presentation:</b><br>

After declaration of the finalists, participants are required to improve upon the prototype/ working model of their project. They will also have to make a presentation covering the technical and financial aspects of their product in a detailed manner. This final presentation and the video will have to be submitted at digitalize@techfest.org before 15th December 2017. The shortlisted teams can however, continue to work on their prototypes till 28th December, 2017. The teams will have to bring their prototypes to be judged and showcased at Techfest 2017-18 during 29th to 31st December, 2017. The working prototype should be as close as possible to the product that the team intends to present to the end user. This would also help in deciding a better estimate of the cost of the prototype, reflecting closely the actual cost of the product.
